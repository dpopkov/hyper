## Project: Simple Chatty Bot

### Description
Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. 
In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming.

### Stage 1/5: Chatty Bot welcomes you

### Objective
For the first stage, you will write a bot that displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation. 
First impressions count!

Your program should print the following lines:

    Hello! My name is {botName}.
    I was created in {birthYear}.

Instead of {botName}, print any name you choose and replace {birthYear} with the current year (four digits).

#### Example
Output:

    Hello! My name is Aid.
    I was created in 2020.

You can change the text if you want but print exactly two lines.

Next, we will use Aid and 2020 as your bot's name and its birth year, but you can change it if you need to.

### Stage 2/5: Print your name

#### Description
     
The greeting part is great, but chatbots are also supposed to interact with a user. 
It's time to implement this functionality.

#### Objective
     
 In this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.
 
 Your program should print the following lines:
     
     Hello! My name is Aid.
     I was created in 2020.
     Please, remind me your name.
     What a great name you have, {yourName}!
     
 You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.
 
 Instead of {yourName}, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.

#### Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: a dialogue with the bot

    Hello! My name is Aid.
    I was created in 2020.
    Please, remind me your name.
    > Max
    What a great name you have, Max!

Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text but not the number of printed lines.
